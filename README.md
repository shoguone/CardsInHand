# CardsInHand
I haven't worked seriously with Unity for over 5 years, thus I didn't have fresh and up-to-date Unity code. So I've done a simple test task as an example.
This is not a finished project. The idea is quite simple: to create a UI for “cards in hand” container for CCG-like game. Cards should be layed out with the arc pattern,  with the possibility of dragging and dropping them on the “table”. A bit of animation to make it juicy. And cards’ parameters are generated randomly, including the art, being fetched from https://picsum.photos/ at the start of the game.
